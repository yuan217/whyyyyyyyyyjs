          ElephantsWorld was founded in 2008 and is a sanctuary for sick, old, disabled, abused and rescued elephants,
          who will receive the rest and joy that they deserve.
          They can enjoy themselves in their own natural environment here until their last breath.
          <br>
          <br>
          At ElephantsWorld we work for the elephants, instead of them for us!
          As a visitor you get to enjoy very memorable experience with these beautiful animals.
          You can help us with taking care of them by feeding them, gathering food and bathing them.
          <br>
          <br>
          ElephantsWorld was founded in 2008 to function as a ‘retirement home’ for elephants that have been injured enduring their work,
          or are too old to continue with this type of work. We are a non-profit organization,
          meaning we are funded exclusively by visitors and donations and every cent we earn goes towards making our elephants lives as pleasant as possible and of course retiring new elephants.
          <br>
          <br>
          So, when you are in Thailand and you wish to spend time with these magnificent animals,
          please consider a visit to ElephantsWorld. We are 32 km from the city of Kanchanaburi or 180 km from Bangkok.
          <br>
          <br>
          The activities you will take part in during your stay help us and our elephants.
          We would not survive without your help. Enjoy your day with the elephants and leave knowing you have helped, not harmed them.

				<p class="sheltersp">
          Ran-Tong (Save&Rescue Elephant Centre) has been established since 2009 after the rescue of “ Boon Som” or blinded elephant from a wicked mahout.
          “Boon Som” after years of abusing hard work in the forest and amphetamines injection, finally he could retire and have an happier life at his new home.
          But it took time… The founder and his family tried to retrieve him from the coma it was in. It took about 6 months for him to recover.
          <br>
          <br>
          The massive wounds on both his shoulder and all over his body were a really sad sight.
          They treated the wounds and gave him vitamins, anti-parasitic and everything they could.
          Slowly Boon Som started to feel better and eat regularly, gaining weight and finally recover.
          Inspiration never stopped for the founder and his family and shortly afterwards, Thong In,
          an aged elephant, was the second elephant joining the family…after him, more and more were being rescued…
          But maintain a an elephant is a really costly activity,
          so the founder decided to running it as a business which is necessary for the survival of those elephants.
          Ran-Tong (Save&Rescue Elephant Centre) is one of the most well-known elephant camp of northern Thailand.
